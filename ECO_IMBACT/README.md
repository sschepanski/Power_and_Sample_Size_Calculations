# ECO-IMBACT Project - Effects of Organic Food on Health

This folder contains materials related to the **ECO-IMBACT** project, a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of consuming biodynamic organic food on the microbiome, immune system, and body composition in overweight and obese children and adolescents.

## Project Overview

The **ECO-IMBACT** project explores how food quality, particularly organic farming practices, influences human health. The study compares conventional and Demeter-certified biodynamic organic food consumption over a 6-week intervention period. Key outcomes include changes in body composition, microbiome diversity, immune response, and pesticide residue levels in urine.

### Research Objectives

1. **Primary Objective**: Assess changes in body composition, specifically fat mass, between intervention and control groups.
2. **Secondary Objectives**: Evaluate microbiome diversity, immune markers, clinical outcomes, and psychological well-being.

## Contents

This folder includes:
- **SampleSize.ipynb**: A simulation-based analysis to determine the sample size required for 80% power, accounting for a 30% dropout rate.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and the purpose of the sample size analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, open the **SampleSize.ipynb** notebook in R and follow the step-by-step instructions within each cell. Ensure all necessary R packages are installed, as outlined in the notebook's setup section.

## Methodology

The sample size calculation focuses on the primary outcome, changes in fat mass, measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis. A power analysis was performed to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups, adjusting for a 30% attrition rate to account for dropouts. Secondary outcomes, including microbiome diversity, immune markers, and psychological outcomes, will be analyzed using similar methodologies to explore the broader impact of biodynamic organic food consumption on health.
