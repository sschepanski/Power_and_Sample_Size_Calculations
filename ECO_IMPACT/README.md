# ECO-IMPACT Project - Effects of Organic Food on Health

This folder contains materials related to the **ECO-IMPACT** project, a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of consuming biodynamic organic food on the microbiome, immune system, and pollutant load in healthy adults.

## Project Overview

The **ECO-IMPACT** project explores how food quality, particularly organic farming practices, influences human health. The study compares conventional and Demeter-certified biodynamic organic food consumption over a 6-week intervention period. Key outcomes include microbiome composition, immune response, and pesticide residue levels in urine.

### Research Objectives

1. **Primary Objective**: Determine changes in body composition between intervention and control groups.
2. **Secondary Objectives**: Evaluate microbiome, immune markers, and psychological well-being.

## Contents

This folder includes:
- **SampleSize.ipynb**: A simulation-based analysis to determine the sample size required for 80% power, accounting for a 30% dropout rate.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and the purpose of the sample size analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, open the **SampleSize.ipynb** notebook in R and follow the step-by-step instructions within each cell. Ensure all necessary R packages are installed, as outlined in the notebook's setup section.

## Methodology

The sample size calculation focuses on the primary outcome, the TNESS questionnaire score, as a measure of symptom severity in seasonal allergies. A power analysis was performed to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups, adjusting for a 20% attrition rate to account for dropouts. Secondary outcomes, including immune response modulation and inflammatory biomarkers, will be analyzed using similar methodologies to explore the broader impact of sauerkraut on immune function.
