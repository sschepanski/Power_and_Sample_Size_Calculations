    "The Nature-Boost project aims to address the rising challenges in long-term care facilities by enhancing the health and relationship between caregivers and residents through innovative, nature-based interventions. The project recognizes the dual burdens on both residents and staff due to increased demand for long-term care services and chronic workforce shortages in caregiving roles. In particular, residents often experience reduced mobility, social isolation, and sensory deprivation, which can impact sleep quality, mood, and overall well-being. Caregivers also face high levels of stress and burnout, contributing to a challenging work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter these challenges, the Nature-Boost project proposes immersive, multi-sensory interventions replicating nature experiences. These include:\n",
    "1. **Olfactory stimuli**: Essential oil blends simulating the scent of the Bavarian forest.\n",
    "2. **Visual stimuli**: VR simulations showing forest scenes.\n",
    "3. **Auditory stimuli**: Natural sounds, such as forest ambiance.\n"

    "1. **Primary Objective**: Assess whether immersive nature-based experiences improve residents' sleep quality.\n",
    "2. **Secondary Objectives**: Evaluate improvements in residents' overall well-being, mood, loneliness, cognitive function, and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, assess changes in caregivers' perceived stress and burnout.\n"

    "The objective of this analysis was to estimate the minimum sample size required per group to achieve adequate statistical power for detecting differences in PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) scores across four intervention groups in the Nature-Boost randomized controlled trial. Given the studyâ€™s design and the inclusion of baseline PSQI scores as a covariate, an ANCOVA model was chosen as the primary method for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed an analytical power analysis using the effect size calculated from Chang et al. (2014) and parameters specific to the Nature-Boost study. A target power of 80% was set, which is typically sufficient for clinical studies. Due to the elderly participant population, we accounted for a 30% dropout rate to ensure adequate power despite potential participant loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the power analysis indicated that a sample size of 43 participants per group would be required to achieve the target power of 80% without attrition. However, with a 30% attrition adjustment, the final recommended sample size increased to 62 participants per group. For the four-group design, this yields a total sample size of 246 participants. This adjusted sample size is expected to provide sufficient power, accounting for the elevated dropout rate, which is anticipated due to participants' advanced age and the physical constraints some may face with VR and sensory technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, recruiting 246 participants in total (62 per group) will allow the Nature-Boost study to detect meaningful differences between intervention groups in terms of sleep quality, even if a significant proportion of participants withdraw. This ensures that the study maintains robust statistical power and can draw reliable conclusions about the impact of nature-based interventions on sleep quality and well-being in long-term care residents.\n"
