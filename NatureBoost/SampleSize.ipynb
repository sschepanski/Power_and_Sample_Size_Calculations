    "The Nature-Boost project aims to address the rising challenges in long-term care facilities by enhancing the health and relationship between caregivers and residents through innovative, nature-based interventions. The project recognizes the dual burdens on both residents and staff due to increased demand for long-term care services and chronic workforce shortages in caregiving roles. In particular, residents often experience reduced mobility, social isolation, and sensory deprivation, which can impact sleep quality, mood, and overall well-being. Caregivers also face high levels of stress and burnout, contributing to a challenging work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter these challenges, the Nature-Boost project proposes immersive, multi-sensory interventions replicating nature experiences. These include:\n",
    "1. **Olfactory stimuli**: Essential oil blends simulating the scent of the Bavarian forest.\n",
    "2. **Visual stimuli**: VR simulations showing forest scenes.\n",
    "3. **Auditory stimuli**: Natural sounds, such as forest ambiance.\n"

    "1. **Primary Objective**: Assess whether immersive nature-based experiences improve residents' sleep quality.\n",
    "2. **Secondary Objectives**: Evaluate improvements in residents' overall well-being, mood, loneliness, cognitive function, and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, assess changes in caregivers' perceived stress and burnout.\n"

    "For this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aim to detect differences in PSQI scores across four intervention groups. Due to the inclusion of baseline covariates (e.g., baseline PSQI scores, age, sex, medication use), an ANCOVA model is more suitable than ANOVA, as it adjusts for these covariates and provides increased precision.\n",

    "### Reference Study Data (Wan et al.)\n",
    "The study by Wan et al. (2024, PMID: 39213857) provides benchmark values for PSQI changes in a control and a VR group, as shown below:\n",

    "| Group          | Baseline PSQI Mean | Post-Treatment PSQI Mean | Standard Deviation (SD) |\n",

    "The objective of this analysis was to estimate the minimum sample size required per group to achieve adequate statistical power for detecting differences in ***PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) scores*** across four intervention groups in the Nature-Boost ***randomized controlled trial***. Given the studyâ€™s design and the inclusion of baseline PSQI scores as a covariate, an ***ANCOVA model*** was chosen as the primary method for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed a simulation-based power analysis to determine the appropriate sample size per group, incrementally increasing the sample size until the simulation achieved the desired power. A target power of ***80%*** was set, which is typically sufficient for clinical studies. Due to the elderly participant population, which includes individuals who are bed-bound, we accounted for a high dropout rate of 40% to ensure adequate power despite potential participant loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the simulation indicated that a sample size of 22 participants per group would be required to achieve the target power of 80% without attrition. However, with a ***40% attrition*** adjustment, the final recommended sample size increased to 37 participants per group. For the four-group design, this yields a total sample size of 148 participants. This adjusted sample size is expected to provide sufficient power, accounting for the elevated dropout rate, which is anticipated due to participants' advanced age and the physical constraints some may face with VR and sensory technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, recruiting ***148 participants in total (37 per group)*** will allow the Nature-Boost study to detect meaningful differences between intervention groups in terms of sleep quality, even if a significant proportion of participants withdraw. This ensures that the study maintains robust statistical power and can draw reliable conclusions about the impact of nature-based interventions on sleep quality and well-being in long-term care residents."
