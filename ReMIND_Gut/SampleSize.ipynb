    "This study investigates whether an 8-week self-administered online meditation program influences gut microbiome composition and SCFA profiles in healthy adults. SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), including butyrate, acetate, and propionate, are microbial metabolites with immunomodulatory properties. They play a role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and modulating systemic inflammation. Given that both SCFAs and the gut microbiome are highly sensitive to dietary intake, the study also includes dietary data (via food frequency questionnaire) as a covariate.\n"

    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis was to estimate the minimum sample size required per group to ensure adequate statistical power for detecting group differences in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations—specifically iso-butyrate levels—at follow-up (T2) in an upcoming randomized controlled trial. Since baseline SCFA concentrations (T1) will be included as a covariate in the primary analysis, an ANCOVA model was selected to account for baseline variability and improve statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size was estimated based on Figure 6A from Raman et al. (2023), which illustrated iso-butyrate levels in meditators before (T1) and after a two-month preparatory phase (T2). The mean difference between T2 and T1 was visually approximated at 0.006 micromolar proportions, and the pooled standard deviation was estimated at 0.0131, yielding a Cohen’s d of 0.458. This corresponds to a Cohen’s f of 0.229, which was then adjusted to 0.274 under the assumption that baseline SCFA levels explain 30% of the variance in follow-up values (R² = 0.30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this adjusted effect size and targeting a conventional power of 80% with a significance level of 0.05, the analysis indicated that a sample size of 54 participants per group would be sufficient, assuming no attrition. To account for an anticipated 20% dropout rate, the final recommended sample size is 68 participants per group, resulting in a total of 136 participants across both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, recruiting 136 participants in total (68 per group) will provide the planned RCT with sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in SCFA outcomes between the intervention and control arms, while accounting for baseline measurements and expected attrition."
