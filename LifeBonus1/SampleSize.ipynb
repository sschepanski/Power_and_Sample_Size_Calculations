    "# Power Analysis for Sample Size Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The following R code calculates the sample size required for conducting a Wilcoxon paired rank sum test based on specified parameters. The Wilcoxon test will be used to assess the significance of differences between paired observations obtained at baseline and after 20 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the degree of goal attainment of participants using the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Outcome\n",
    "The primary endpoint of interest is the degree of goal attainment of participants, assessed using the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) after 20 weeks of treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package Information\n",
    "- The power analysis is conducted using the `pwr` package in R.\n",
    "- The `pwr` package provides functions for power analysis in various statistical tests, including non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon test.\n",

    "To theoretically justify a margin of 0.075 in your study, you would need to consider several factors related to the context of your research, the intervention being studied, and the expected effect size. Here are some steps you can take to justify this margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical Relevance: Determine what constitutes a meaningful difference in the context of your study. This could be based on clinical guidelines, expert opinions, or prior research. For example, you might consult clinical experts to understand what level of improvement in the proportion of individuals achieving a T-score of 50 or higher would be considered clinically significant.\n",

    "Minimally Important Difference (MID): Identify the minimally important difference (MID) or smallest effect size that would be clinically meaningful. This could be based on patient-reported outcomes, changes in symptom severity, or other relevant measures. The margin of 0.075 should reflect this MID.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Considerations: Consider the statistical power of your study and the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. A margin of 0.075 should be chosen to ensure that your study has adequate power to detect the expected effect size while controlling the risk of a false positive (Type I error).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Literature Review: Review existing literature on similar interventions or outcomes to see if there are any established thresholds or benchmarks for effect sizes in comparable studies. This can help contextualize your choice of margin and provide additional justification."
