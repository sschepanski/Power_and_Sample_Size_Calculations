    "This sample size calculation determines the minimum numbers of cancer and non-cancer participants required in a paired diagnostic accuracy study comparing CT with canine olfactory testing at a lung cancer center. Both index tests are performed on the same participants; diagnostic truth is established by an independent reference standard: histology positive for cancer, and benign histology or protocolized imaging follow-up (up to 24 months; double read, blinded to dog results) for non-cancer. The dog result must not influence verification decisions.\n",

In this cancer subgroup, the discordance is split evenly between cases where the dog is correct and the CT is wrong, and vice versa, reflecting an expectation of similar diagnostic accuracy. For the non-cancer subgroup, where the aim is to show a ten percentage point advantage in specificity for the dogs, a higher discordance rate of 15% is assumed, with most disagreements favoring the dog.

    "The sensitivity analysis illustrates how strongly the required sample size depends on the assumed discordance rates between dogs and CT in each subgroup. Lower discordance rates lead to smaller required sample sizes, while higher rates increase the number of participants needed. The most conservative scenario (line 9), with a discordance of 12% among cancer cases and 20% among non-cancer cases, results in the largest calculated sample size: 377 cancer cases and 157 non-cancer cases, for a total of 534 paired subjects. This scenario assumes that the two tests disagree relatively often, **about one in eight cancer cases and one in five non-cancer cases**, and that these disagreements are split according to the expected differences in accuracy. Under such conditions, the study would require more than one year of recruitment if the lung cancer center screens approximately 500 individuals annually, particularly because not all screened individuals will meet the inclusion criteria or have complete follow-up. In practice, using more moderate discordance rates (such as those in the main analysis with 12% and 15%) would reduce the required total to 495, which is more achievable within a single year."
