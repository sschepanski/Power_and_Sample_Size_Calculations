Given the intensity and length of the intervention (6 weeks, 24 sessions), a dropout rate of 35% is assumed to reflect potential participant burden in this preventive, non-clinical sample."

    "The objective of this analysis was to estimate the minimum sample size required per group to ensure adequate statistical power for detecting group differences in subjective relaxation as measured by the “Ruhe” subscale of the Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsfragebogen (MDBF) following a 6-week digital intervention. The planned randomized controlled trial includes four parallel arms and uses a one-way ANCOVA model for the primary analysis, with baseline scores included as covariates to improve statistical power and reduce residual variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected effect size was based on outcome data from the previous MindSpaceOne 1.0 study, where Cohen’s d ranged between 0.33 and 0.49 for comparisons between hypnotherapeutic interventions and control. A conservative average was adopted and translated to a Cohen’s f of 0.175. Assuming baseline values explain 20% of the outcome variance (R² = 0.20), this results in an adjusted Cohen’s f of approximately 0.196 for the ANCOVA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this adjusted effect size and targeting a conventional power of 80% with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the estimated sample size per group is 73 participants (without dropout). To account for an anticipated dropout rate of 35%—which reflects the expected burden of a high-frequency 6-week digital intervention—the adjusted sample size increases to 105 participants per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, two of the four study arms will be split into subgroups for further follow-up analyses after the main intervention phase. To ensure sufficient power for these subsequent subgroup comparisons, the initial sample size in those two arms must be doubled. As a result, the final recommended total sample size is 630 participants across all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, recruiting 630 participants will ensure that MindSpaceOne 2.0 is sufficiently powered to detect meaningful group differences in subjective relaxation, accommodate expected dropout, and support additional planned subgroup analyses within the trial design."
