# Sample Size and Power Analyses Repository

This repository contains sample size and power analyses for various research projects in psychology and medical science. Each project has its own subdirectory, organized under the main directory, and provides detailed calculations, code, and documentation for sample size estimation based on primary and secondary research outcomes.

## Repository Structure

The main directory includes separate folders for each project, each with its own specific analyses and methodological focus:

- **HappyKraut**: Contains sample size and power analyses for the "HappyKraut" project, which investigates the effects of plant-based mood enhancers on well-being.
  
- **LifeBonus1**: Includes power analyses for the "LifeBonus1" project, focused on examining the impact of lifestyle intervention programs on psychological and physical health parameters.

- **NatureBoost**: Contains sample size calculations and power analyses for the "NatureBoost" project, which studies the effects of nature-based interventions on sleep quality and well-being in long-term care settings.

- **MindfulPolice**: Contains sample size calculations and power analysis for the "MindfulPolice" project, which studies the effect of
a customized mindfulness-baed intervention on diverse officer-relevant outcomes.

Each project folder contains relevant scripts and documentation on the methodology, calculations, and results.

## Getting Started

To clone and set up this repository locally:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sschepanski/power_and_sample_size_calculations.git
   ```

2. Open R and navigate to the project directory where you can run each R script or R Markdown file to view the sample size calculations and power analyses for each project.

## **Repository Usage**

All analyses were conducted in the statistical software R and include:

- Detailed power analyses and sample size calculations for the primary and secondary endpoints of each project.
- Commented scripts documenting each step and decision within the analyses.
- Information on specific power calculations, effect size estimations, and considerations of relevant covariates and anticipated dropout rates.

## **Future Projects and Extensions**

This repository is continuously expanding as new projects are added. Future sample size and power analyses will follow the same structure and will be organized into individual project folders.
