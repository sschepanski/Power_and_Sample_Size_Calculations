    "\n",
    "This sample size calculation determines the minimum number of mother–child dyads required to adequately power the key developmental pathway investigated in this project: how maternal immune activation (MIA) in late pregnancy and Hofbauer-cell functional phenotypes relate to infant temperament across early development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the full analytical strategy uses latent growth curve modelling (LGCM) and structural equation models (SEM) to integrate repeated IBQ-R assessments, Hofbauer-cell functional readouts, and maternal immune indices, power estimation is based on a simplified regression formulation. This is standard practice in longitudinal mechanistic cohort studies and provides a conservative lower bound for the analyzable sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary objectives for power estimation:\n",
    "The sample size is derived from the hypothesis that: 'Variation in maternal immune activation and Hofbauer-cell phagocytic function predicts individual differences in early offspring temperament, operationalized as the IBQ-R orienting/regulation score at 24 months.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The preditor block consists of:\n",
    "1. Latent maternal immune activation (MIA) score\n",
    "2. Hofbauer-cell phagocytic index\n",
    "3. MIA × Hofbauer-cell interaction term\n",
    "\n",
    "Models further adjust for maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI, consistent with the main analytical plan.\n",
    "Power is calculated for this predictor block using a multiple regression approximation of the SEM path, with α = 0.05 (two-sided) and 80% power."

    "## Planning assumptions and resulting analytical sample\n",
    "The effect-size assumptions are informed by published findings showing small-to-moderate associations between maternal inflammatory markers and IBQ-R temperament dimensions in infancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the parent cohort expects ~18% attrition from birth to the 24-month temperament assessment, recruitment must be increased accordingly:\n",
    "- Required analyzable sample: ~180 dyads\n",
    "- Required recruitment target: ~220 dyads\n",
    "\n",
    "This value is fully aligned with the operational constraints and recruitment capacity of the parent study and provides adequate power for the primary mechanistic hypothesis. Analyses involving transcriptional modules or sex-specific interactions are exploratory and are not used for sample size determination."
